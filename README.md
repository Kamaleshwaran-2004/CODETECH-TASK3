Alice disconnected.

Bob disconnection

✅ Strengths
🔄 Multithreading:

The server correctly handles each client using a new thread (via ClientHandler).

Prevents blocking behavior when multiple clients connect simultaneously.

📡 Socket Communication:

Utilizes java.net.ServerSocket and Socket for establishing connections.

Data sent via InputStream/OutputStream wrapped in BufferedReader/PrintWriter — a good choice for line-based text communication.

📣 Broadcast Logic:

Each message from a client is relayed to all other clients.

Ensures real-time group chat behavior.

🔐 Clean Exit Handling:

Supports “exit” command for client disconnection.

Automatically removes client from the broadcast list and notifies others.

🧼 Code Simplicity:

Clean and understandable structure, making it suitable for learning or internships.

Well-contained ClientHandler inner class keeps things organized.

⚠️ Suggestions for Improvement
🚫 Potential Concurrency Issues:

clientHandlers is a HashSet — not thread-safe.

Replace it with a thread-safe alternative like:

java
Copy
Edit
private static Set<ClientHandler> clientHandlers = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet<>());
💥 Exception Logging:

Consider logging exceptions with more context or using logging frameworks (e.g., java.util.logging) instead of just printing stack traces.

🛑 Server Shutdown Option:

Currently runs infinitely. Add a shutdown hook or admin command to gracefully stop the server.

💬 Client User Interface:

Text-based terminal works fine, but consider a simple Swing GUI for bonus points during internship review.

📦 Modularization (Advanced):

You could split ClientHandler into a separate file for cleaner code separation.

Add utilities or config classes if you expand the project.

🧪 Testing:

Add some basic unit/integration tests using JUnit for socket handling if intended for production (optional for internship).

🧩 Optional Features to Add for Enhancement
User list command (e.g., /users) to see connected clients.

Private messages (e.g., /msg user Hello).

Message timestamps.

GUI (Swing/JavaFX).

Emoji support or input sanitization.
